The main element of learning from this game is the canvas tag in HTML
the canvas.getContext('2d');
the canvas.fillStyle = 'color';
the canvas.rect(screenXaxis, screenYaxis, objectWidth, objectHeight);
the creating a circle method
and fillText

Also I learned how to incorporate sounds into DOM and pick it from JS


NEXT: Update
I can create a start menu
I can add more sounds
I can have level of difficulty in the game (incorporate levels, incrementing ball speed every next level & increasing reaction time for computer paddle)
I can have option for keyboard for 2 players
I can randomly generate bonuses from the net to give the paddle more power or take power.
